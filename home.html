            <p>While working in a variety of fields, including education, retail, and management, I have gained a wide breadth of skills that I 
                now apply to entrepreneurship. As part of this transition, I have done a number of software and website design projects to expand and hone
                my skills. These projects run the spectrum from goofy and whimsical to more serious commercial B2B offerings. I am always
                adding new skills and sharpening current ones; this is a current snapshot.
